# Operational Events & Status Effects

The checkout system isn't always stable. In fact, it's rarely stable. Outside of normal operations, several "Events" can occur that affect traffic or system performance.

## Status Effects

A **Status Effect** is a temporary condition that modifies the behavior of the system. These are often triggered by external factors or scheduled activities.

### Common Traffic Effects

- **Flash Sale**: A sudden, massive spike in external traffic (usually `initiatePurchase`). These are high-revenue but high-risk periods.
- **Scheduled Load Test**: Synthetic traffic generated by the QA team to test our limits.

## The Warning Phase

Not all events are surprises. Our monitoring system can often predict an upcoming event based on "early indicators" (or because the Marketing team actually told us this time).

### Warning Tickets

When an event is imminent, a **Warning Ticket** will be opened in your Pager.

- **Wait Time**: The ticket description will usually tell you how many cycles you have before the event actually starts.
- **Preparation**: Use this time to scale up your services or adjust your limits _before_ the traffic hits. Scaling takes time, so don't wait until the event is active!

## Active Phase

Once the warning period ends, the event becomes **Active**.

- You will see a notification in the system alert area.
- Metrics will reflect the new traffic levels or performance penalties.
- The event will automatically resolve after its duration expires.
