# The Coffee Machine (Model: Bean-O-Matic 3000)

This is the most important piece of hardware in the office.

## Maintenance

- If the light is blinking red, it needs water.
- If it's blinking blue, it needs beans.
- If it's blinking yellow, it's sentient. Do not make eye contact.

## Troubleshooting

- **Coffee is cold**: You probably didn't turn it on.
- **Coffee is too strong**: You used the "Engineer Mode" setting. This is intended for P0 outages only.
- **Machine is on fire**: Please refer to the [Log Storage](log-storage.md) documentation, as the fire is likely related to our server heat output.
